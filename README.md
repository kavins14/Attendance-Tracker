# Attendance-Tracker

This Java application is an attendance tracking system that helps manage attendances in a classroom setting. This was built from scratch as a high school project for my Computer 3 class. The two main technologies used in this project are Java (developing the application) and MySQL (database)

## Features
1. Add/Remove Courses
2. Create/Delete Students
3. Add students to courses
4. Remove students from courses
5. Create/Delete/Edit Attendance Tracking Sessions (the time when you teacher checks the attendance)

Features to be added:
1. Searching up data of individual students


## Setting It Up
Setting it up is simple.

1. Set up mysql in your computer and import the database from file 'attendance.sql'
2. Install Java Mysql Connector for your specific operating system (OSX used in this project)
3. Update mysql login credentials in dbconnect.java file
4. Run Main1.java
5. Viola!

Try it out!
